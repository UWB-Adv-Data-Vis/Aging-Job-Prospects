# Aging Job Prospects
Aging Job Prospects: The Employment Age Matrix, Forecasting the Uncertain Future

The data dashboard challenge for the Winter 2026 BDATA 412 Advanced Data Visualization course with Prof. Trujillo. The challenge uses data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor  Statistics for Labor Force (BLS) to develop interactive data visualizations to illumniate patterns in the labor force age across occupation.

*    Be capable of running, modifying, and sharing scripts to accomplish analyze data and visualize in one scripting language (R).
*    Manage project development to store, organize, and track code using digital collaboration tools for reproducibility (GitHub).
*    Create a data dashboard for the web to disseminate findings and visualization (R Shiny)
*    Describe the rationale, methods, results, and broader social context of your student-led project that used data to answer an interesting question.
*    Describe and use different types of critical and scientific thinking to develop inquiry into selected projects and critique visualizations.

## Overview
This data challenge directly addresses the concerns of the future labor market in relation to previous trends. This project examines data from the U.S. Labor Bureau spanning between 2011-2024 to portray the ages that workers joining and leaving the workforce across different occupations. 

## Intent of the Dashboard
The dashboard is intended to clearly present occupational employment trends by age and to provide insights into historical patterns, structural shifts, industry trends, and automation impacts, helping to inform policymakers and analysts through evidence-based decision-making. It functions as a supplemental resource to enable users to compare the different occupation performance across age groups.

## Data Challenge Statement
This challenge asks teams to turn complex labor data into a clear, easy-to-use dashboard using R Shiny and ggplot2. We intend the dashboards to be accessible and understandable to the general public, prioritizing creative layouts, clear labeling, and clear data storytelling so that it enables non-technical users to engage with the visualizations meaningfully. By making the dashboard easily accessible to the public, it will provide a good reference for students or any public stakeholders trying to understand the trends of labor markets. 

### Why This Challenge Matters:
These employment numbers helps users to identify emerging trends and risks in different age groups while helping to develop better policy interventions, economic planning, and potential workforce incentives strategies. 

### What We Hope to Learn:
The dashboard will help users explore the data and find information. Users should be able to quickly see which states have the biggest rent problems, understand regional patterns, and see how inequality shows up in housing costs. The dashboard will show patterns in the data while giving enough background for users to understand housing affordability in different areas.

## Purpose 

Inform stakeholders to navigate the job market and mangage expectations for career prospects in different occupations.
We aim to make complex labor force data clear and accessible through interactive visuals, helping users understand workforce entry, peak years, retirement patterns, and generational job prospects.

## Stakeholders:
 - Policymakers and city planners working on housing policies
 - Economists and researchers studying income inequality and cost of living
 - Non-profit groups and workforce advocates
 - Students and the general public interested in social issues and job markey
 - Recruiters and hiring professionals

## Targeted Questions for Visual Analytics

The dashboard _could_ answer these key questions through visuals:
 1.	What are the entry age groups for different occupations?
 2.	Peak years for occupations? Peak being defined as salary earned to hours worked
 3.	Retirement years for occupations?
 4.	Unemployment by occupation and unemployment?
 6.	Is gen-z screwed with their employment opportunities in the current job market?
 7.	Which generation(s) are projected to never retire? 

## Design Principles:
 - Simplify: Keep it simple but informative: focus on 1-2 strong visualizations per person.
 - Easy: Leverage the use of easy to use tabs and menus to support mobile devices.
 - Clean: Clear labels, details-demand, and notes for more information
 - Coherent: Same color scheme across all panels
 - Flexible: Works on different screen sizes including desktops, phones, tablets, and laptops.
 - Understandable: Follow ggplot2 best practices
 - **_Please replace this README with one for your produced dashboard and include a link to the original challenge._**

## Data Biography

The main data sets we collected were the employed persons by detailed occupation and age from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A secondary data set was collected on unemployment from the same source. These data sets have the purpose of informing decisions regarding labor or giving evidence to support policies. The data was collected by the American government, by the agency of Bureau of Labor Statistics under the United States Department of Labor. For the 2024 employed persons dataset, 161,346 observations are present, with the observations representing numbers in thousands.  
 
The collection methods for these data sets are explicitly mentioned in their [Handbook of Methods](https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/about.htm) section on their website. However, for a brief summary of these methods, the Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys businesses and agencies, then receives lists of employees or job titles provided. As well as utilizes as much public information conducted from these surveys as well as census, government and private data. This has impacts on managers, analysts, and government officials. The public nature helps management occupations better understand the state of occupations and age ranges.  
 
This then lets management teams have a more informed idea of the teams they wish to create or keep using the public data in their decisions in cultivating the overall make up of their workforce. Analysts on the other hand will be able to discover information on the trend of occupations and age, allowing them to create observations and study this data which will then be utilized in things such as reports to that very management previously discussed. While government officials could use these analyses on occupation and age data to be better informed when proposing policies that affect the make up of the industries these occupations are situated in.  
 
These data sets are all summarized data from another source, as they are all tables of counts. Known limitations here are that they may have under or over- representation. Occupation categories could also be too general and cover very different fields. There is missing data in the data sets  in the median age column, represented by dashes. There are accessible notes at the bottom to explain what median age means and the dash (“-”) indicates that there is no data. There are quite a bit of papers specifically on the data taken from theUS Bureau of Labor and Statistics.

### Dataset:

The data source that we will be using is from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for Labor Force, we will be looking at the annual average years from 2011 to 2024 dataset of 11b. Employed persons by detailed occupation and age. This range attempts to capture the different trends of more than a decade of labor market dynamics from the Great Recession recovery, COVID-19, and now the current labor market restructuring. The dataset is split between management/professional occupations and service occupations, spanning over 300 occupations combined, each is a table.
